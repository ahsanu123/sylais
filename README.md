## Introduction

Sylais is program to integrate 3 component: whisper.cpp, llama.cpp, and piper. the purpose is simple, convert captured voice into text, then use text for ask to AI model, then capture the answer and convert it back into voice.
I dont want it online, i just want use locally to improve my english conversation, so the simpler the better.

- 20 juni 2025 ‚è∞ 06:14, able to build whisper and run example (also my own recorded audio file), and its just work even on low quality audio (low quality microphone), here is the output, as you can see its only take about 3 seconds for 17 second recording.

```shell
main: processing 'Recording.mp3' (289537 samples, 18.1 sec), 4 threads, 1 processors, 5 beams + best of 5, lang = en, task = transcribe, timestamps = 1 ...

- to use piper, you only need compiled binary (relased under their github), and simple echo command

```shell
D:\project\personalProject\piper>echo 'hello piper' | piper -m en_GB-jenny_dioco-medium.onnx -c en_GB-jenny_dioco-medium.onnx.json
[2025-06-20 07:41:52.944] [piper] [info] Loaded voice in 0.3411954 second(s)
